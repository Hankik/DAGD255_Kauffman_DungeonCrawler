I can't leave behind that precious flower!
Where is flower?! I can't leave without flower!
I hope little flower is safe!
I am not coward!I will not leave behind flower!
How could I betray my love!
If I left without flower, flower could hurt!
It is kind of dark down there! Maybe flower should go down first...
*Beep* *Boop* *Bop* 
Shall I embrace a cold metal heart? No! I will retrieve flower before I depart!
Sheesh! Leaving without little flower, I couldn't do something like that!
I should leave with my friend, flower.
